# Lake Baikal Radiocarbon Database — Interactive Computing Environment (ICE)

This repository contains the interactive computing environment (ICE) used to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in:

Newall et al. (2026), _A Complete Database of AMS Radiocarbon Estimates from Lake Baikal Sediment Cores with a Lake-Wide Assessment of TOC Age Offsets_, Earth System Science Data

The ICE includes the curated Lake Baikal radiocarbon dataset (PANGAEA export), a reproducible computational environment, and a Jupyter notebook implementing all age-offset calculations used in the paper and all non-map figures used.

## Running the ICE online (Binder)

To execute the notebook directly in your browser **without installing anything**, open:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/samrsnewall/baikal_essd_ice/HEAD)

This launches a fully containerised JupyterLab session with all dependencies and the dataset preloaded.
