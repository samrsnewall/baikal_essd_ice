This repository contains the interactive computing environment (ICE) used to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in:

PAPER CITATION

The ICE includes the curated Lake Baikal radiocarbon dataset (PANGAEA export), a reproducible computational environment, and a Jupyter notebook implementing all age-offset calculations used in the paper and all non-map figures used.

## Running the ICE online (Binder)

To execute the notebook directly in your browser **without installing anything**, open:
